									DevOps Principle & Tools

# Defination 

By the name of devops is a collebration of developement side as well as operation side but one should know that devops is not a tool software of framework devops is a combination of tools
which help for automation of whole infrastructure and devops is a impliment of a agile methodogoly as on the developement side as well as operation side 


1. why should learn devOps 

it is mainly some reason 

great scalability
deploy faster
easy recovery
improve security 
time saving 
production support

Here are the some key principle 

1.Collaboration and Communication: Break down silos between developement team as well as operation team for better communication and teamwork. 

2.Automation: Automate repetitive task such as a code integration, testing, deployment and infrastructure provisioning this reduce manually errors and speed up processes 

3.Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Integrate the code changes frequently (CI) and deliver software update for production regulary (CD) 

4.Infrastructure as a code (IAC): Manage and provision infrastructure using code and automation tools this allow for consistent, repeatable, and version control infrastructure setup 

5.Monitoring and Feedback: Implement robust monitoring to gian insight into the performance and reliability of application and infrastructure use this feedback to continuously improve processes, 
address issues proactively, and enhance user experience.

6.Customer-Centric Action: Focus on delivering the value of customer by ontinuously iterating and improving based on their feedback. 



Tools:


1.Version Control : Git

2.Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Circle CI.

3.Configuration Management: Ansible, chef, puppet.

4.Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, AWS Cloudformation 

5.Containerization and Orchestration: Docker, k8s

6.Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, Grafana

7.Artifact Repository: Jfrog Artifact, Nexus Repository

9.Security and Compliance: Snyk, SonarQube
